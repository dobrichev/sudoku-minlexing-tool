# sudoku-minlexing-tool
Any Sudoku puzzle doesn't change its essential properties if any combination of the Validity Preserving Transformations (VPT) is applied. VPT are transposition, any permutation of the bands, stacks, rows within a band, columns within a stack, and re-labeling. This tool provides efficient code for finding the minimal lexicographical representation.
